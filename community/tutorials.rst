Tutorials and resources
=======================

.. warning:: Many tutorials from 1-2 years ago are for Godot 3.x, please make sure that they are on 
             the Godot 4.x as there are some huge differences between the GDScript syntax of Godot 3.x
             and Godot 4.x.

.. note:: You can easily spot the difference from the rendering method in the top right.
          On Godot 3.x there is GLES2 and GLES3
          However, on Godot 4.x there is Forward+, Mobile and Compatibility.

This is a list of third-party tutorials and resources created by the Godot community. For resources, remember that there is the official `Godot Asset Library <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_ full of official and community resources too! Also, have a look at this `huge list over at Reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/an0iq5/godot_tutorials_list_of_video_and_written/>`_.

Where to start
--------------

The Godot video tutorials by `GDQuest <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxboW7x0jZqFdvMdCFKTMsQ/playlists>`_, `Godotneers <https://www.youtube.com/@godotneers>`_ and `KidsCanCode <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNaPQ5uLX5iIEHUCLmfAgKg/playlists>`_ are well-regarded in the community and often recommended as a gentle introduction to beginners.

If you're interested in a complete introduction to programming using Godot and GDScript, the unofficial `Godot Tutorials <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnr9ojBEQGgwbcKsZC-2rIg>`_ YouTube channel is a good place to start.

GDQuest's *Learn GDScript From Zero* is a free and open source interactive tutorial for absolute beginners to learn to program with Godot's GDScript language. It is available as a `desktop application <https://gdquest.itch.io/learn-godot-gdscript>`_  or `in the browser <https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript>`_.

Some tutorials mentioned below provide more advanced tutorials, e.g. on 3D or shaders.
